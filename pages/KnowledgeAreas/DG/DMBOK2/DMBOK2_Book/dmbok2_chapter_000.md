## Preface {#preface .unnumbered}

> AMA International is pleased to release the second edition of the DAMA
> Guide to the Data Management Body of Knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK2). Since
> the publication of the first edition in 2009, significant developments
> have taken place in the field of data management. Data Governance has
> become a standard
>
> structure in many organizations, new technologies have enabled the
> collection and use of 'Big Data' (semi- structured and unstructured
> data in a wide range of formats), and the importance of data ethics
> has grown along with our ability to explore and exploit the vast
> amount of data and information produced as part of our daily lives.
>
> These changes are exciting. They also place new and increasing demands
> on our profession. DAMA has responded to these changes by
> reformulating the DAMA Data Management Framework (the DAMA Wheel),
> adding detail and clarification, and expanding the scope of the DMBOK:

-   Context diagrams for all Knowledge Areas have been improved and
    updated.

-   Data Integration and Interoperability has been added as a new
    Knowledge Area to highlight its importance (Chapter 8).

-   Data Ethics has been called out as a separate chapter due to the
    increasing necessity of an ethical approach to all aspects of data
    management (Chapter 2).

-   The role of governance has been described both as a function
    (Chapter 3) and in relation to each Knowledge Area.

-   A similar approach has been taken with organizational change
    management, which is described in Chapter 17 and incorporated into
    the Knowledge Area chapters.

-   New chapters on Big Data and Data Science (Chapter 14) and Data
    Management Maturity Assessment (Chapter 15) help organizations
    understand where they want to go and give them the tools to get
    there.

-   The second edition also includes a newly formulated set of data
    management principles to support the ability of organizations to
    manage their data effectively and get value from their data assets
    (Chapter 1).

> We hope the DMBOK2 will serve data management professionals across the
> globe as a valuable resource and guide. Nevertheless, we also
> recognize it is only a starting point. Real advancement will come as
> we apply and learn from these ideas. DAMA exists to enable members to
> learn continuously, by sharing ideas, trends, problems, and solutions.
