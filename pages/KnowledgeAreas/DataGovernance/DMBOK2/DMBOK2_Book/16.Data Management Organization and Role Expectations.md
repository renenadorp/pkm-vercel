# CHAPTER 16 - Data Management Organization and Role Expectations 

##### Introduction

> he data landscape is quickly evolving and with it, organizations need
> to evolve the ways they manage and govern data. Most organizations
> today are faced with an increasing volume of data captured through a
> wide range of processes in a range of formats. The increase in volume
> and variety adds
>
> complexity to data management. At the same time, data consumers now
> demand quick and easy access to data. They want to be able to
> understand data and use it to address critical business questions in a
> timely manner. Data management and data governance organizations must
> be flexible enough to work effectively in this evolving environment.
> To do so, they need to clarify basic questions about ownership,
> collaboration, accountability, and decision-making.
>
> This section will describe a set of principles that should be
> considered when putting together a data management or data governance
> organization. It refers to both data governance and data management
> because data governance provides the guidance and business context for
> the activities executed by the Data Management Organization. There is
> no perfect organizational structure for either. While common
> principles should be applied to organizing around data governance and
> data management, much of the detail will depend on the drivers of that
> enterprise's industry and the corporate culture of the enterprise
> itself.

##### Understand Existing Organization and Cultural Norms

> Awareness, ownership, and accountability are the keys to activating
> and engaging people in data management initiatives, policies, and
> processes. Before defining any new organization or attempting to
> improve an existing one, it is important to understand current state
> of component pieces, related to culture, the existing operating model,
> and people. See Figure 106. For example:

-   **The role of data in the organization**: What key processes are
    data-driven? How are data requirements defined and understood? How
    well-recognized is the role that data plays in organizational
    strategy?

-   Leadership

#### People {#people .unnumbered}

> Figure 106 Assess Current State to Create an Operating Model

-   **Cultural norms about data**: Are there potential cultural
    obstacles to implementing or improving management and governance
    structures?

-   **Data management and data governance practices**: How and by whom
    is data-related work executed? How and by whom are decisions about
    data made?

-   **How work is organized and executed**: For example, what is the
    relation between project-focused and operational execution? What
    committee structures are in place that can support the data
    management effort?

-   **How reporting relationships are organized**: For example, is the
    organization centralized or decentralized, hierarchical or flat?

-   **Skill levels**: What is the level of data knowledge and data
    management knowledge of SMEs and other

> stakeholders, from line staff to executives?
>
> After forming a picture of current state, assess the level of
> satisfaction with current state in order to gain insight into the
> organization's data management needs and priorities. For example:

-   Does the organization have the information it needs to make sound,
    timely business decisions?

-   Does the organization have confidence in its revenue reports?

-   Can it track the organizational key performance indicators?

-   Is the organization in compliance with all laws regarding management
    of data?

> Most organizations that seek to improve their data management or
> governance practices are in the middle of the capability maturity
> scale (i.e., they are neither 0's nor 5's on the CMM scale). (See
> Chapter 15.) To craft a relevant Data Management Organization, it is
> important to understand and accommodate the existing company culture
> and organizational norms. If the Data Management Organization is not
> aligned to the existing decision- making and committee constructs, it
> will be challenging to sustain it over time. Therefore, it makes sense
> to evolve these organizations, rather than imposing radical changes.
>
> A Data Management Organization should align with a company's
> organizational hierarchy and resources. Finding the right people
> requires an understanding of both the functional and the political
> role of data

>
> management within an organization. The aim should be cross-functional
> participation from the various business stakeholders. To accomplish
> this:

-   Identify employees currently performing data management functions;
    recognize and involve them first. Hire additional resources only as
    data management and governance needs grow.

-   Examine the methods the organization is using to manage data and
    determine how processes can be improved. Determine how much change
    is likely to be required to improve data management practices.

-   Roadmap the kinds of changes that need to take place from an
    organizational perspective to better meet requirements.

##### Data Management Organizational Constructs

> A critical step in Data Management Organization design is identifying
> the best-fit operating model for the organization. The operating model
> is a framework articulating roles, responsibilities, and
> decision-making processes. It describes how people and functions will
> collaborate.
>
> A reliable operating model helps create accountability by ensuring the
> right functions within the organization are represented. It
> facilitates communication and provides a process to resolve issues.
> While it forms the basis for the organizational structure, the
> operating model is not an org chart -- it is not about putting names
> in boxes, but about describing the relationship between the component
> pieces of the organization.
>
> This section will present a high-level overview of the pros and cons
> of decentralized, network, hybrid, federated, and centralized
> operating models.

####### Decentralized Operating Model

> In a decentralized model, data management responsibilities are
> distributed across different lines of business and IT (see Figure
> 107). Collaboration is committee-based; there is no single owner. Many
> Data Management programs start as grass root efforts to unify the data
> management practices across an organization and therefore have a
> decentralized structure.
>
> The benefits of this model include its relatively flat structure and
> its alignment of data management to lines of business or IT. This
> alignment generally means there is a clear understanding of data
> requirements. It is also relatively easy to implement or improve.
>
> The drawbacks include the challenge of having many participants
> involved with governance bodies and in decision-making. It is
> generally harder to implement collaborative decisions than centralized
> edicts. Decentralized models are generally less formal and because of
> this, they can be harder to sustain over time. To be successful, they
> need to have ways to enforce consistency of practices. This can be
> difficult to coordinate. It is also often difficult to define data
> ownership with a decentralized model.

> Figure 107 Decentralized Operating Model

####### Network Operating Model

> ![](./media/media/image229.png){width="3.3966655730533684in"
> height="3.616665573053368in"}Decentralized informality can be made
> more formal through a documented series of connections and
> accountabilities via a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and
> Informed) matrix. This is called a networked model because it operates
> as a series of known connections between people and roles and can be
> diagrammed as a 'network.' (See Figure 108.)
>
> Figure 108 Network Operating Model
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT OR GAN IZATIO N AND ROLE E XP ECTATION S • 5 5 5
>
> A network model's benefits are similar to those of a decentralized
> model (flat structure, alignment, quick set up). The addition of a
> RACI helps create accountability without impacting the organizational
> charts. The additional drawback is the need to maintain and enforce
> expectations related to the RACI.

####### Centralized Operating Model

> ![](./media/media/image230.png){width="4.016666666666667in"
> height="3.933333333333333in"}The most formal and mature data
> management operating model is a centralized one (see Figure 109). Here
> everything is owned by the Data Management Organization. Those
> involved in governing and managing data report directly to a data
> management leader who is responsible for Governance, Stewardship,
> Metadata Management, Data Quality Management, Master and Reference
> Data Management, Data Architecture, Business Analysis, etc.
>
> Figure 109 Centralized Operating Model
>
> The benefit of a centralized model is that it establishes a formal
> executive position for data management or data governance. There is
> one person at the top. Decision-making is easier because
> accountability is clear. Within the organization, data can be managed
> by type or subject area. The drawback is that implementation of a
> centralized model generally requires significant organizational
> change. There is also a risk that formal separation of the data
> management role moves it away for core business processes and can
> result in knowledge being lost over time.
>
> A centralized model generally requires a new organization. The
> question arises: Where does the Data Management Organization fit
> within the overall enterprise? Who leads it and to whom does the
> leader report? It
>
> 5 5 6 • D MBOK 2
>
> is becoming more common for a Data Management Organization *not* to
> report to the CIO because of the desire to maintain a business, rather
> than IT, perspective on data. These organizations are also commonly
> part of a shared services or operations team or part of the Chief Data
> Officer's organization. (See Section 6.1.)

####### Hybrid Operating Model

> ![](./media/media/image231.jpeg){width="3.6266666666666665in"
> height="3.0933333333333333in"}As its name implies, the hybrid
> operating model encompasses benefits of both the decentralized and
> centralized models (see Figure 110). In a hybrid model, a centralized
> data management Center of Excellence works with decentralized business
> unit groups, usually through both an executive steering committee
> representing key lines of business and a set of tactical working
> groups addressing specific problems.
>
> Figure 110 Hybrid Operating Model
>
> In this model, some roles remain decentralized. For example, Data
> Architects may stay within an Enterprise Architecture group; lines of
> business may have their own Data Quality teams. Which roles are
> centralized and which stay decentralized can vary widely, depending
> largely on organizational culture.
>
> The primary benefit of a hybrid model is that it establishes
> appropriate direction from the top of the organization. There is an
> executive accountable for data management and/or governance. Business
> Unit teams have broad accountability and can align to business
> priorities to provide greater focus. They benefit from the support of
> a dedicated data management Center of Excellence that can help bring
> focus to specific challenges.
>
> The challenges include getting the organization set up, since doing so
> generally requires additional headcount to staff a Center of
> Excellence. Business Unit teams may have different priorities, and
> these will need to be managed from an enterprise perspective. In
> addition, there are sometimes conflicts between the priorities of the
> central organization and those of the decentralized organizations.
>

####### Federated Operating Model

> ![](./media/media/image232.png){width="4.11in" height="4.01in"}A
> variation on the hybrid operating model, the federated model provides
> additional layers of centralization / decentralization, which are
> often required in large global enterprises. Imagine an enterprise Data
> Management Organization with multiple hybrid data management models
> delineated based on division or region. (See Figure 111.)
>
> Figure 111 Federated Operating Model
>
> A federated model provides a centralized strategy with decentralized
> execution. Therefore, for large enterprises it may be the only model
> that can work. A data management executive who is accountable across
> the organization runs the enterprise Center of Excellence. Of course,
> different lines of business are empowered to meet requirements based
> on their needs and priorities. Federation enables the organization to
> prioritize based on specific data entities, divisional challenges, or
> regional priorities.
>
> The main drawback is complexity. There are a lot of layers, and there
> needs to be a balance between autonomy for lines of business and the
> needs of the enterprise. This balance can impact enterprise
> priorities.

####### Identifying the Best Model for an Organization

> The operating model is a starting point for improving data management
> and data governance practices. Introducing it requires an
> understanding of how it may impact the current organization and how it
> will likely
>
> 5 5 8 • D MBOK 2
>
> need to evolve over time. Since the operating model will serve as the
> structure through which policies and processes will be defined,
> approved, and executed, it is critical to identify the best fit for an
> organization.
>
> Assess whether the current organizational structure is centralized,
> decentralized, or a combination, hierarchical or relatively flat.
> Characterize how independent divisions or regions are. Do they operate
> almost self- sufficiently? Are their requirements and goals very
> different from each other? Most importantly, try to determine how
> decisions are made (e.g., democratically or by fiat), as well as how
> they are implemented.
>
> The answers should give a starting point to understand the
> organization's location on the spectrum between decentralized and
> centralized.

####### DMO Alternatives and Design Considerations

> Most organizations start with a decentralized model before they move
> toward a formal Data Management Organization (DMO). As an organization
> sees the impact of improvements in data quality, it may start to
> formalize accountability through a data management RACI matrix and
> evolve into a network model. Over time, synergies between the
> distributed roles will become more obvious and economies of scale will
> be identified that will pull some roles and people into organized
> groups. Eventually, this can morph into a hybrid or federated model.
>
> Some organizations don't have the luxury of going through this
> maturity process. They are forced to mature quickly based on a market
> shock or new government regulations. In such a case, it is important
> to proactively address the discomfort associated with the
> organizational change if it is to be successful and sustainable. (See
> Chapter 17.)
>
> Whichever model is chosen, remember that simplicity and usability are
> essential for acceptance and sustainability. If the operating model
> fits the culture of a company, then data management and proper
> governance can be embedded in operations and aligned with strategy.
> Keep these tips in mind when constructing an Operating Model:

-   Determine the starting point by assessing current state

-   Tie the operating model to organization structure

-   Take into account:

    -   Organization Complexity + Maturity

    -   Domain Complexity + Maturity

    -   Scalability

-   Get executive sponsorship -- a **must** for a sustainable model

-   Ensure that any leadership forum (steering committee, advisory
    council, board) is a decision-making body

-   Consider pilot programs and waves of implementation

-   Focus on high-value, high-impact data domains

-   Use what already exists

-   Never take a One-Size-Fits-All approach

##### Critical Success Factors

> Ten factors have been consistently shown to play a key role in the
> success of effective Data Management Organizations, regardless of
> their structure:

1.  Executive sponsorship

2.  Clear vision

3.  Proactive change management

4.  Leadership alignment

5.  Communication

6.  Stakeholder engagement

7.  Orientation and training

8.  Adoption measurement

9.  Adherence to guiding principles

10. Evolution not revolution

####### Executive Sponsorship

> Having the right executive sponsor ensures that stakeholders affected
> by a Data Management program receive the necessary guidance to
> transition efficiently and effectively through the changes needed to
> put the new data- focused organization together and sustain it for the
> long term. The executive sponsor should understand and believe in the
> initiative. He or she must be able to effectively engage other leaders
> in support of the changes.

####### Clear Vision

> A clear vision for the Data Management Organization, along with a plan
> to drive it, is critical to success. Organizational leaders must
> ensure that all stakeholders who are affected by data management --
> both internal and external -- understand and internalize what data
> management is, why it is important, and how their work will affect and
> be affected by it.

####### Proactive Change Management

> Managing the change associated with creating a Data Management
> Organization requires planning for, managing, and sustaining change.
> Applying organizational change management to the establishment of a
> Data Management Organization addresses the people challenges and
> increases the likelihood that desired Data Management Organization is
> sustainable over time. (See Chapter 17.)
>
> 5 6 0 • D MBOK 2

####### Leadership Alignment

> Leadership alignment ensures that there is agreement on -- and unified
> support for -- the need for a Data Management program and that there
> is agreement on how success will be defined. Leadership alignment
> includes both the alignment between the leaders' goals and the data
> management outcomes and value *and* alignment in purpose amongst the
> leaders.
>
> If leaders are not aligned with each other, they will end up sending
> mixed messages that can lead to resistance and eventually derail the
> change. Therefore, it is critical to assess -- and regularly re-assess
> -- leaders at all levels to identify disconnects and take steps to
> quickly address them.

####### Communication

> Communication should start early and continue openly and often. The
> organization must ensure that stakeholders have a clear understanding
> of what data management is and why it is important to the company,
> what is changing, and what changes in behavior are required. People
> can't improve the way they manage data if they don't know what they
> are supposed to do differently. Creating a story around the data
> management initiative and building key messages around it helps these
> processes.
>
> Messages must be consistent, underscoring the importance of data
> management. In addition, they should be customized according to
> stakeholder group. For example, the level of education or amount of
> training needed by different groups concerning data management will
> vary. Messages should be repeated as needed and continually tested
> over time to ensure they are effectively getting out there and that
> awareness and understanding are building.

####### Stakeholder Engagement

> Individuals, as well as groups, affected by a data management
> initiative will react differently to the new program and their role
> within it. How the organization engages these stakeholders -- how they
> communicate with, respond to, and involve them -- will have a
> significant impact on the success of the initiative.
>
> A stakeholder analysis helps the organization better understand those
> affected by data management changes. By taking that information and
> mapping stakeholders according to level of influence within the
> organization and level of interest in (or affect due to) the data
> management implementation, the organization can determine the best
> approach to engaging different stakeholders in the change process.
> (See Section 5.3.)

####### Orientation and Training

> Education is essential to making data management happen, although
> different groups will require different types and levels of education.
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT OR GAN IZATIO N AND ROLE E XP ECTATION S • 5 6 1
>
> Leaders will need orientation to the broader aspects of data
> management and the value to the company. Data stewards, owners, and
> custodians (i.e., those on the frontlines of change) will require
> in-depth understanding of the data management initiative. Focused
> training will allow them to perform their roles effectively. This
> means training on new policies, processes, techniques, procedures, and
> even tools.

####### Adoption Measurement

> It is important to build metrics around the progress and adoption of
> the data management guidelines and plan to know that the data
> management roadmap is working and that it will continue working. Plan
> to measure:

-   Adoption

-   Amount of improvement, or the delta from a previous state

-   The enabling aspects of data management -- how well does data
    management influence solutions with measurable results?

-   Improved processes, projects

-   Improved identification and reaction to risk

-   The innovation aspect of data management -- how well does data
    management fundamentally change how business is conducted?

-   Trusted analytics

> The enabling aspect of data management could focus on the improvement
> of data-centric processes, such as month-end closing, identification
> of risk, and efficiency of project execution. The innovation aspect of
> data management could focus on improvement in decision-making and
> analytics through improved and trusted data.

####### Adherence to Guiding Principles

> A guiding principle is a statement that articulates shared
> organizational values, underlies strategic vision and mission, and
> serves as a basis for integrated decision-making. Guiding principles
> constitute the rules, constraints, overriding criteria, and behaviors
> by which an organization abides in its daily activities in the long
> term. Regardless of whether there is a decentralized or centralized
> operating model, or anything in between, it is critical to establish
> and agree upon guiding principles so that all participants behave in
> synchronistic ways. The guiding principles serve as the reference
> points from which all decisions will be made. Establishing them is an
> important first step in creating a Data Management program that
> effectively drives changes in behavior.

####### Evolution Not Revolution

> In all aspects of data management, the philosophy of 'evolution not
> revolution' helps to minimize big changes or large-scale high-risk
> projects. It is important to establish an organization that evolves
> and matures over time. Incrementally improving the way that data is
> managed and prioritized by business objectives will ensure that

5.  6 2 • D MBOK 2

> new policies and processes are adopted and behavioral change is
> sustained. Incremental change is also much easier to justify so it is
> easier to gain stakeholder support and buy-in, and get those critical
> participants involved.

##### Build the Data Management Organization

####### Identify Current Data Management Participants

> When implementing the operating model, start with teams already
> engaged in data management activities. This will minimize the effect
> on the organization and will help to ensure that the focus of the team
> is data, not HR or politics.
>
> Start by reviewing existing data management activities, such as who
> creates and manages data, who measures data quality, or even who has
> 'data' in their job title. Survey the organization to find out who may
> already be fulfilling needed roles and responsibilities. Such
> individuals may hold different titles. They are likely part of a
> distributed organization and not necessarily recognized by the
> enterprise. After compiling a list of 'data people,' identify gaps.
> What additional roles and skill sets are required to execute the data
> strategy? In many cases, people in other parts of the organization
> have analogous, transferrable skill sets. Remember, people already in
> the organization bring valuable knowledge and experience to a data
> management effort.
>
> Once an inventory is complete, and people are assigned to the roles,
> review their compensation and align it with the expectations of data
> management. Likely, the Human Resources department will get involved
> to validate the titles, roles, compensation, and performance
> objectives. Ensure that the roles are assigned to the right people at
> the right level within the organization, so that when they are
> involved in decision-making, they have the credibility to make
> decisions that stick.

####### Identify Committee Participants

> No matter which operating model an organization chooses, some
> governance work will need to be done by a Data Governance Steering
> Committee and by working groups. It is important to get the right
> people on the Steering Committee and to use their time well. Keep them
> well-informed and focused on the ways that improved data management
> will help them reach business objectives, including strategic goals.
>
> Many organizations are reluctant to start yet another committee since
> there are so many already existing. It is often easier to take
> advantage of existing committees to advance data management topics
> than it is to start a new one. But take this route cautiously. The
> main risk in using an existing committee is that data management may
> not get the attention it requires, especially in the early stages. The
> process to staff either a senior steering committee or a more tactical
> working group requires conducting stakeholder analysis and, through
> that, identifying executive sponsors.
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT OR GAN IZATIO N AND ROLE E XP ECTATION S • 5 6 3

####### Identify and Analyze Stakeholders

> A stakeholder is any person or group who can influence or be affected
> by the Data Management program. Stakeholders can be internal to or
> external to the organization. They include individual SMEs, senior
> leaders, teams of employees, committees, customers, government or
> regulatory agencies, brokers, agents, vendors, etc. Internal
> stakeholders can come from IT, operations, compliance, legal, HR,
> finance or other lines of business. External stakeholders can be
> influential, and it is important that their needs be accounted for by
> the Data Management Organization.
>
> A stakeholder analysis can help the organization determine the best
> approach to engaging participants in the data management process and
> leveraging their roles within the operating model. Insight gained from
> the analysis is also helpful in determining how to best allocate time
> and other limited resources. The earlier this analysis is conducted,
> the better, since the more the organization is able to anticipate
> reactions to change, the more it can plan for them. A stakeholder
> analysis will help answer questions like:

-   Who will be affected by data management?

-   How will roles and responsibilities shift?

-   How might those affected respond to the changes?

-   What issues and concerns will people have?

> The analysis will result in a list of stakeholders, their goals and
> priorities, and why those goals are important to them. Figure out what
> actions are needed for stakeholders based on the analysis. Pay
> particular attention to what needs to be done to bring along critical
> stakeholders, those that can make or break an organization's data
> management success, especially its initial priorities. Consider:

-   Who controls critical resources

-   Who could block data management initiatives, either directly or
    indirectly

-   Who could influence other critical constituents

-   How supportive stakeholders are of the upcoming changes

> Figure 112 provides a simple map to help prioritize stakeholders based
> on their influence, their level of interest in the program, or the
> degree to which the program will impact them.

####### Involve the Stakeholders

> After identifying the stakeholders and a good Executive Sponsor, or a
> short list from which to choose, it is important to clearly articulate
> why each of the stakeholders should be involved. They may not jump at
> the chance. The person or team driving the data management effort
> should articulate the reasons each stakeholder is necessary to the
> success of the program. This means understanding their personal and
> professional goals, and being able to link the output from data
> management processes to their goals, so they can see a direct
> connection. Without an understanding of this direct connection, they
> may be willing to help out in the short term, but they will not
> provide long-term support or assistance.

##### Interactions Between the DMO and Other Data-oriented Bodies

> Once the operating model is established and participants are
> identified, it is time to move the people into the newly authorized
> roles. Operationalizing the organization means establishing the
> committees and engaging with stakeholders. In a centralized model,
> most of the data management activity will be controlled within one
> organization. With a decentralized or network model, though, the Data
> Management Organization will need to work with other groups that have
> a significant impact on the way that data is managed. Those groups are
> typically:

-   Chief Data Officer Organization

-   Data Governance Bodies

-   Data Quality

-   Enterprise Architecture

####### The Chief Data Officer

> While most companies recognize at some level that data is a valuable
> corporate asset, only a few have appointed a Chief Data Officer (CDO)
> to help bridge the gap between technology and business and evangelize
> an enterprise-wide data management strategy at a senior level. This
> role is on the rise, however, with Gartner estimating that half of all
> regulated companies will employ a CDO by 2017 (Gartner, 2015).
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT OR GAN IZATIO N AND ROLE E XP ECTATION S • 5 6 5
>
> While the requirements and functions of a CDO are specific to each
> company's culture, organizational structure, and business needs, many
> CDOs tend to be part business strategist, adviser, data quality
> steward and all around data management ambassador.
>
> In 2014, Dataversity published research outlining common mandates for
> a CDO.^103^ These included:

-   Establishing an organizational data strategy

-   Aligning data-centric requirements with available IT and business
    resources

-   Establishing data governance standards, policies and procedures

-   Providing advice (and perhaps services) to the business for
    data-dependent initiatives, such as business analytics, Big Data,
    data quality, and data technologies

-   Evangelizing the importance of good information management
    principles to internal and external business stakeholders

-   Oversight of data usage in analytics and Business Intelligence
    Dataversity's findings also highlighted shifting focuses across
    different industries.

> Regardless of industry, it is common for a Data Management
> Organization to report up through the CDO. In a more decentralized
> operating model, the CDO is responsible for the data strategy, but
> resources that are in IT, operations, or other lines of business
> *execute* that strategy. Some DMOs are established initially with the
> CDO just determining the strategy, and over time other aspects of data
> management, governance, and analytics are folded under the CDO
> umbrella as efficiencies and economies of scale are identified.

####### Data Governance

> Data Governance is the organizing framework for establishing the
> strategy, objectives, and policy for effectively managing corporate
> data. It consists of the processes, policies, organization, and
> technologies required to manage and ensure the availability,
> usability, integrity, consistency, auditability, and security of data.
> Since a Data Governance Program consists of the inter-workings of
> strategy, standards, policies and communication regarding data, it has
> a synergistic relationship with data management. Governance provides a
> framework for data management to engage and align with the business
> priorities and stakeholders.
>
> Within a centralized model, the Data Governance Office can report to
> the Data Management Organization or vice versa. When a Data Management
> program is focused on establishing policies and guidelines needed to
> manage data as an asset, the Data Governance Office can act as the
> lead, and the Data Management Organization reports to (or is matrixed
> to) the Data Governance Office. This occurs many times in highly
> regulated environments where the emphasis is on policy and
> accountability.

> 'Doing the right things' and data management is about 'Doing things
> right' (Ladley, 2012). They are two sides of the equation needed to

> support the guidelines of data governance and the efficiencies of data
> management. Participants in a Data Governance Working Group can be
> drawn from a Data Management Organization, and a Data Management
> Organization can use the mandate and 'air cover' provided by the
> governance oversight.

####### Data Quality

> Data Quality Management is a key capability of a data management
> practice and organization. Many Data Management Organizations start
> with a focus on the quality of data because there is a desire to
> measure and improve the quality of data across the organization. It is
> possible to address Data Quality within a line of business, or even
> within an application, without having to involve other groups or
> manage cross-functional complexities. However, as a data quality
> practice matures, the organization will benefit from a unified
> approach to data quality; for example, by establishing a Center of
> Excellence. The goal shifts to improving the quality of data that is
> shared across lines of business or applications, often with a focus on
> Master Data Management.
>
> It is common that a Data Management Organization develops organically
> out of a Data Quality initiative as the investment in improving data
> quality adds value across the company, and efforts associated with
> improving quality expand into other disciplines like Master,
> Reference, and Metadata Management.
>
> A Data Quality program can evolve into similar operating models as an
> over-arching Data Management program, although it is rare for Data
> Quality functions to become completely centralized in any sizable
> company because there is most often aspects of data quality that are
> executed on a line-of-business or application level. Because a Data
> Quality program can be decentralized, networked, or a hybrid (using a
> Center of Excellence approach), align the Data Quality operating model
> to that of the overall Data Management Organization, in order to use
> consistent stakeholders, relationships, accountabilities, standards,
> processes, and even tools.

####### Enterprise Architecture

> An Enterprise Architecture group designs and documents the master
> blueprints for an organization to articulate and optimize how to meet
> its strategic objectives. The disciplines within an Enterprise
> Architecture practice include:

-   Technology Architecture

-   Application Architecture

-   Information (or Data) Architecture

-   Business Architecture

> DATA MAN AGE MENT OR GAN IZATIO N AND ROLE E XP ECTATION S • 5 6 7
>
> Data Architecture is a key capability of an effective Data Management
> Organization. Therefore, Data Architects can sit in either group, with
> a dotted line to the other group.
>
> When Data Architects sit within a Data Management Organization,
> typically they interface with the rest of their architecture peers via
> Architecture Review Boards (ARB), committees that review and give
> guidance on the way that architecture standards are implemented or
> affected by projects and programs. An ARB can approve or disapprove
> new projects and systems based on their level of adherence to
> architectural standards.
>
> When an organization does not have Data Architects, Data Management
> can interface with the Architecture organization in a few ways:

-   **Through Data Governance**: Since both Data Management and
    Enterprise Architecture participate in a Data Governance program,
    the governance working group and committee structure can provide a
    platform for aligning goals, expectations, standards, and
    activities.

-   **Through the ARB**: As data management projects are brought to the
    ARB, the Architecture group would provide guidance, feedback, and
    approvals.

-   **Ad-hoc**: If there are no formal committees, then the Data
    Management Lead should periodically meet with the Architecture Lead
    to ensure there is shared knowledge and understanding of projects
    and processes that impact the other party. Over time, the difficulty
    of managing this ad hoc process will likely lead to the development
    of a formal role or committee to facilitate discussions and
    decisions.

> If there were Data Architects, then they would represent architecture
> in governance discussions and would lead the discussions in the ARB.

####### Managing a Global Organization

> Global companies face complex data management challenges based on the
> volume and variety of country- specific laws and regulations,
> especially those regarding the privacy and security of certain types
> of data. Add these issues to the typical management challenges of a
> global organization (distributed work force, systems, time zones, and
> languages), and the task of efficiently and effectively managing data
> can seem like an endless exercise of herding cats.
>
> Global organizations need to pay special attention to:

-   Adhering to standards

-   Synchronizing processes

-   Aligning accountability

-   Training and communication

-   Monitoring and measuring effectively

-   Developing economies of scale

-   Reducing duplication of effort

> As Data Management programs and Organizations become more global, the
> networked or federated models become more attractive where
> accountabilities can be aligned, standards can be followed, and
> regional variations can still be accommodated.

##### Data Management Roles

> Data management roles can be defined at the functional or individual
> level. Names for the roles will differ between organizations and some
> organizations will have greater or lesser need for some of the roles.
>
> All IT roles can be mapped to points in the data lifecycle, so they
> all impact the management of data, whether directly (as with a Data
> Architect who designs a data warehouse) or indirectly (as with a Web
> Developer who programs a website). Likewise, many business roles
> create, access, or manipulate data. Some roles, such as Data Quality
> Analyst, require a mix of technical skills and business knowledge. The
> functions and roles described below focus on those that are directed
> engaged in the management of data.

####### Organizational Roles

> IT Data Management Organizations provide a range of services from
> data, application, and technical architecture to database
> administration. A centralized Data Management Services Organization is
> focused solely on data management. This team may include a DM
> Executive, other DM Managers, Data Architects, Data Analysts, Data
> Quality Analysts, Database Administrators, Data Security
> Administrators, Metadata Specialists, Data Modelers, Data
> Administrators, Data Warehouse Architects, Data Integration
> Architects, and Business Intelligence Analysts.
>
> A federated Data Management Services approach will include a set of IT
> units, each focused on a facet of data management. Especially in large
> organizations, IT functions are often decentralized. For example, each
> business function may have its own team of Software Developers. A
> hybrid approach is also taken. For example, while each business
> function may have its own developers, the DBA function may be
> centralized.
>
> Business functions focused on data management are most often
> associated with Data Governance or Enterprise Information Management
> teams. For example, Data Stewards are often part of a Data Governance
> Organization. Such an organization will facilitate Data Governance
> bodies, such as the Data Governance Council.

####### Individual Roles

> Individual roles may be defined under business or IT. Some are hybrid
> roles that require knowledge of systems and business processes.
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT OR GAN IZATIO N AND ROLE E XP ECTATION S • 5 6 9

1.  *Executive Roles*

> Data Management executives may be on the business or technology side
> of the house. Chief Information Officer and Chief Technology Officer
> are well-established roles in IT. The concept of Chief Data Officer on
> the business-side has gained a lot of credibility in the past decade
> and many organizations have hired CDOs.

2.  *Business Roles*

> Business roles focus largely on data governance functions, especially
> stewardship. Data Stewards are usually recognized subject matter
> experts who are assigned accountability for Metadata and data quality
> of business entities, subject areas, or databases. Stewards play
> different roles, depending on organizational priorities. The initial
> focus of stewardship is often on defining business terms and valid
> values for their subject areas. In many organizations, Stewards also
> define and maintain data quality requirements and business rules for
> assigned data attributes, help identify and resolve data issues, and
> provide input into data standards, policies, and procedures. Stewards
> may function at the enterprise, business unit, or functional level.
> Their role may be formal ('data steward' is part of the title) or
> informal (they steward data, but have another job title).
>
> In addition to Data Stewards, Business Process Analysts and Process
> Architects contribute to ensuring that business process models and the
> actual processes that create data are sound and support downstream
> uses.
>
> Other business-based knowledge workers, such as business analyst
> consumers of data and information who add value to the data for the
> organization, contribute to the overall management of data.

## Data Management and Organizational Change Management {#data-management-and-organizational-change-management .unnumbered}

##### Introduction

> or most organizations, improving data management practices requires
> changing how people work together and how they understand the role of
> data in their organizations, as well as the way they use data and
> deploy technology to support organizational processes. Successful data
> management practices
>
> require, among other factors:

-   Learning to manage on the horizontal by aligning accountabilities
    along the Information Value chain

-   Changing focus from vertical (silo) accountability to shared
    stewardship of information

-   Evolving information quality from a niche business concern or the
    job of the IT department into a core value of the organization

-   Shifting thinking about information quality from 'data cleansing and
    scorecards' to a more

> fundamental organizational capability

-   Implementing processes to measure the cost of poor data management
    and the value of disciplined data management

> This level of change is not achieved through technology, even though
> appropriate use of software tools can support delivery. It is instead
> achieved through a careful and structured approach to the management
> of change in the organization. Change will be required at all levels.
> It is critical to manage and coordinate change to avoid dead-end
> initiatives, loss of trust, and damage to the credibility of the
> information management function and its leadership.
>
> Data management professionals who understand formal change management
> will be more successful in bringing about changes that will help their
> organizations get more value from their data. To do so, it is
> important to understand:

-   Why change fails

-   The triggers for effective change

-   The barriers to change

-   How people experience change

##### Laws of Change

> Experts in organizational change management recognize a set of
> fundamental 'Laws of Change' that describe why change is not easy.
> Recognizing these at the beginning of the change process enables
> success.

-   **Organizations don't change, people change**: Change does not
    happen because a new organization is announced or a new system is
    implemented. It takes place when people behave differently because
    they recognize the value in doing so. The process of improving data
    management practices and implementing formal data governance will
    have far-reaching effects on an organization. People will be asked
    to change how they work with data and how they interact with each
    other on activities involving data.

-   **People don't resist change. They resist being changed**:
    Individuals will not adopt change if they see it as arbitrary or
    dictatorial. They are more likely to change if they have been
    engaged in defining the change and if they understand the vision
    driving the change, as well as when and how change will take place.
    Part of change management for data initiatives involves working with
    teams to build organizational understanding of the value of improved
    data management practices.

-   **Things are the way they are because they got that way**: There may
    be good historic reasons for things being the way they are. At some
    point in the past, someone defined the business requirements,
    defined the process, designed the systems, wrote the policy, or
    defined the business model that now requires change. Understanding
    the origins of current data management practices will help the
    organization avoid past mistakes. If staff members are given a voice
    in the change, they are more likely to understand new initiatives as
    improvements.

-   **Unless there is push to change, things will likely stay the
    same**: If you want an improvement, something must be done
    differently. As Einstein famously said: "You can't solve a problem
    with the level of thinking that created it in the first place."

-   **Change would be easy if it weren't for all the people**: The
    'technology' of change is often easy. The challenge comes in dealing
    with the natural variation that arises in people.

> Change requires Change Agents, people who pay attention to the people
> and not just the systems. Change Agents actively listen to employees,
> customers, and other stakeholders to catch problems before they arise
> and execute the change more smoothly.
>
> Ultimately, change requires a clear VISION of Change Goals
> communicated vividly and regularly to stakeholders to get engagement,
> buy-in, backing, and (importantly) continued support when challenges
> arise.

##### Not Managing a Change: Managing a Transition

> Change management expert William Bridges emphasizes the centrality of
> transition in the change management process. He defines *transition*
> as the psychological process that people go through to come to terms
> with the new situation. While many people think of change solely in
> terms of a new beginning, Bridges asserts that change involves moving
> through three distinct phases, starting with the ending of the
> existing state. Endings are difficult because people need to let go of
> existing conditions. People then enter the Neutral Zone, in which the
> existing state has not quite ended and the new state has not quite
> begun. Change is complete when the new state is established (see Table
> 34). Of these three, the Neutral Zone is the least predictable and
> most confusing, because it is a mix of old and new. If the people in
> the organization do not transition through the Neutral Zone, then the
> organization is at risk of slipping back into old habits and failing
> to sustain the change.
>
> Bridges maintains that the single biggest reason organizational
> changes fail is that people driving change rarely think about endings
> and therefore do not manage the impact of endings on people. He
> states: "Most organizations try to start with a beginning, rather than
> finishing with it. They pay no attention to endings. They do not
> acknowledge the existence of the neutral zone, and then wonder why
> people have so much difficulty with change" (Bridges, 2009).
>
> When experiencing a change, all individuals go through all three
> phases, but at different speeds. Progression depends on factors such
> as past experience, personal preferred style, the degree of
> involvement in recognizing the problem and developing possible
> solutions, and the extent to which they feel pushed towards a change
> rather than moving towards it voluntarily.

|              | -   Example: Having a baby. After a few months in the |
|              |     > neutral zone of turmoil, you come to a stage    |
|              |     > when you cannot imagine life without your new   |

> managers should be aware of as they help people transition.

-   The Ending

    -   Help everyone to understand the current problems and why the
        > change is necessary.

    -   Identify who is likely to lose what. Remember that loss of
        > friends and close working colleagues is as important to some
        > as the loss of status and power is to others.

    -   Losses are subjective. The things one person grieves about may
        > mean nothing to someone

> else. Accept the importance of subjective losses. Don't argue with
> others about how they perceive the loss, and don't be surprised at
> other people's reactions to loss.

-   Expect and accept signs of grieving and acknowledge losses openly
    > and sympathetically.

-   Define what is over and what is not. People must make the break at
    > some time and trying to cling on to old ways prolongs
    > difficulties.

-   Treat the past with respect. People have probably worked extremely
    > hard in what may have

> been very difficult conditions. Recognize that and show that the work
> is valued.

-   Show how ending something ensures the things that matter to people
    > are continued and improved.

-   Give people information. Then do it again and again and again in a
    > variety of ways -- written

> information to go away and read, as well as the opportunity to talk
> and ask questions.

> to be engaged to initiate the change and what likely points of
> resistance might be.

-   The Neutral Zone

    -   Recognize this as a difficult phase (mix of old and new) but
        > that everyone must go through it.

    -   Get people involved and working together; give them time and
        > space to experiment and test new ideas.

    -   Help people to feel that they are still valued.

    -   Praise people with good ideas, even if not every good idea works
        > as expected. The Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) model encourages
        > trying things out, and learning from each cycle.

    -   Give people information; do it again and again and again in a
        > variety of ways.

    -   Provide feedback about the results of the ideas being tested and
        > decisions made.

-   The New Beginning

    -   Do not force a beginning before its time.

    -   Ensure people know what part they are to play in the new system.

    -   Make sure policies, procedures, and priorities are clear; do not
        > send mixed messages.

    -   Plan to celebrate the new beginning and give the credit to those
        > who have made the change.

##### Kotter's Eight Errors of Change Management

> In *Leading Change,* John P. Kotter, one of the most respected
> researchers in the field of Change Management, outlines eight reasons
> why organization fail to execute change. These provide perspective on
> issues that commonly arise in the context of information and data
> management.

####### Error #1: Allowing Too Much Complacency

> According to Kotter, the biggest mistake people make when trying to
> change organizations is plunging ahead without first establishing a
> high enough sense of urgency among their peers and superiors. (This is
> related to the need to drive up dissatisfaction with the status quo
> identified in the Gleicher formula; see Section 6.) Kotter's analysis
> provides valuable pointers for Change Managers looking to avoid the
> errors of others. Change Agents often:

-   Overestimate their ability to force big changes on the organization

-   Underestimate how difficult it can be to shift people out of their
    comfort zones

-   Don't see how their actions and approach might reinforce the status
    quo by driving up defensiveness

> 5 7 8 • D MBOK 2

-   Rush in where angels fear to tread -- kicking off change activities
    without sufficient communication of what change is required or why
    change is required (the Vision)

-   Confuse urgency with anxiety, which in turn leads to fear and
    resistance as stakeholders retrench (often quite literally) in their
    silos

> While it is tempting to think that in the face of organizational
> crisis, complacency would not be a problem, often the opposite is the
> case. Stakeholders often cling to the status quo in the face of too
> many (often conflicting) demands for change (which are often processed
> as 'if everything is important, then nothing is important').

####### Error #2: Failing to Create a Sufficiently Powerful Guiding Coalition

> Kotter identifies that major change is almost impossible without the
> active support from the head of the organization and without a
> coalition of other leaders coming together to guide the change.
> Leadership engagement is especially important in data governance
> efforts, as these require significant behavioral changes. Without

> the argument for the long-term benefits of better governance.
>
> A Guiding Coalition is a powerful and enthusiastic team of volunteers
> from across the organization that helps to put new strategies into
> effect and transform the organization. A key challenge in developing a
> Guiding Coalition is identifying who needs to be involved. (See
> Section 5.2.)

####### Error #3: Underestimating the Power of Vision

> Urgency and a strong guiding team are useless without a clear,
> sensible vision of the change. The vision provides the context of the
> change effort. It helps people understand the meaning of any

>
> For example, stating, "*We will implement a new integrated financial
> reporting and analytics suite built on \[insert name of technology
> here\] by the end of Quarter 1*" is a laudable and measurable goal.
> However, it does little to communicate a clear and compelling

####### Error #5: Permitting Obstacles to Block the Vision

> New initiatives fail when people feel disempowered by huge obstacles
> in their path, even when they fully embrace the need for and direction
> of the proposed change. As part of its transformation, the
> organization must identify and respond to different kinds of
> roadblocks:

-   **Psychological**: Roadblocks that exist in people's heads must be
    addressed based on their causes. Do they stem from fear, lack of
    knowledge, or some other cause?

-   **Structural**: Roadblocks due to organizational structures such as
    narrow job categories or performance appraisal systems that force
    people to choose between the Vision and their own self-interest must
    be addressed as part of the change management process. Change
    management should address structural incentives and disincentives to
    change.

-   **Active resistance**: What roadblocks exist due to people who
    refuse to adapt to the new set of circumstances and who make demands
    that are inconsistent with the Transformation? If key members of the
    organization make the right noises about the change vision but fail
    to alter their behaviors or reward the required behaviors or
    continue to operate in incompatible ways, the execution of the
    vision will falter and could fail.

> Kotter calls on "smart people" in organizations to confront these
> obstacles. If they do not, others will feel disempowered and change
> will be undermined.

####### Error #6: Failing to Create Short-Term Wins

> Real change takes time. Anyone who has ever embarked on a fitness
> regime or a weight-loss plan knows that the secret to keeping going is
> to have regular milestone targets that keep up momentum and motivation
> by marking progress. Anything that involves a long-term commitment and
> investment of effort and resources requires some element of early and
> regular feedback of success.
>
> Complex change efforts require short-term goals in support of
> long-term objectives. Meeting these goals allows the team to celebrate
> and maintain momentum. The key thing is to **create** the short-term
> win rather than merely hoping for it. In successful transformations,
> managers actively establish early goals, achieve these goals, and
> reward the team. Without systematic efforts to guarantee success,
> change is likely to fail.
>
> *4.6.1 Examples in Information Management Context*
>
> In an information management context, the short-term wins and goals
> often arise from the resolution of an identified problem. For example,
> if the development of a Business Glossary is a key deliverable of a
> data governance initiative, a short-term win might come from solving a
> problem related to inconsistent understanding of data (i.e., two

####### Error #7: Declaring Victory Too Soon

> All too often in Change projects, particularly ones stretching over
> several years, there is a temptation to declare success at the first
> major performance improvement. Quick wins and early wins are powerful
> tools to keep up momentum and morale. However, any suggestion that the

>
> *4.7.1 Example in Information Management Context*
>
> The classic example of 'Mission Accomplished' syndrome is the scenario
> where the implementation of a technology is viewed as the route to

####### Error \# 8: Neglecting to Anchor Changes Firmly in the Corporate Culture

> Organizations don't change, people change. Until new behaviors are

> change effort is removed. Kotter is clear: You ignore culture at your

>
> 5 8 2 • D MBOK 2
>
> The two keys to anchoring the change in the culture of the

-   Consciously showing people how specific behaviors and attitudes have

-   Taking sufficient time to embed the change of approach in the next

##### Kotter's Eight Stage Process for Major Change

> In addition to the Eight Errors of Change Management, Kotter
> recognizes a set of common obstacles to change:

-   Inward focused cultures

-   Paralyzing bureaucracy

-   Parochial politics

-   Low levels of trust

-   Lack of team work

-   Arrogance

-   Lack of or failure of leadership

-   Fear of the unknown

> To combat these, he proposes an eight-step model for major change.
> Kotter's model provides a framework within which each of these issues
> can be addressed in a way that supports sustainable long-term change.
> Each step is associated with one of the fundamental errors that
> undermine transformation efforts.
>
> The first four steps of the model soften entrenched status quo
> positions. As Kotter says, this effort is only needed because change
> is not easy.
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT A ND ORGA N IZAT ION AL CHA NG E MANA GEM ENT • 5 8

>
> The next three steps (5 to 7) introduce new practices and ways of
> working. The last step locks the changes in place and provides the
> platform for future gains and improvement.
>
> Kotter advises that there is no short cut in following these steps.
> All successful change efforts must go through all eight steps.
> Focusing on steps 5, 6, and 7 is tempting. However, that does not
> provide a solid foundation for sustaining the change (no vision, no
> Guiding Coalition, no dissatisfaction with the status quo). Likewise,
> it is important to reinforce each step of as you move through the
> process, using quick wins to bolster the vision and the communication

####### Establishing a Sense of Urgency

> People will find a thousand ways to withhold cooperation from
> something they think is unnecessary. A clear and compelling sense of

>
> In the information management context, several factors can create a

-   Regulatory changes

-   Threats to security of information

-   Risks to business continuity

-   Changes to business strategy

-   Mergers and acquisitions

-   Regulatory audit or litigation threats

-   Changes to technology

-   Changes to capability of competitors in the market

-   Media commentary about an organization's or an industry's
    information management issues

> 5 8 4 • D MBOK 2

1.  *Sources of Complacency*

> Kotter identifies nine reasons why organizations and people can be
> complacent. (See Figure 115)

-   In the absence of a visible crisis, it is difficult to raise a sense
    of urgency.

-   The trappings of success can drown out the urgency of some
    situations.

-   Measuring staff against low performance standards or standards that
    don't compare against external benchmarks or internal long-term
    trends.

-   Overly narrow functional goals, with different performance metrics
    for different functional units, can

> lead to a situation where no one is responsible when overall
> organizational performance is poor or suffering.

-   If internal planning and control systems are (or can be) rigged or
    gamed to make it easy for everyone to reach their goals, it is easy
    to be complacent.

-   If the only source of performance feedback is from the faulty
    internal systems, there is no sanity check of the correctness of
    complacency.

-   Where problems are identified or where external performance feedback
    is gathered, it is often attacked as being damaging to morale,
    hurtful to others, or likely to cause an argument. Rather than take
    the information as an input into an evaluation of organization
    performance, the culture is to 'kill the messenger'.

-   For very simple psychological reasons people don't accept things
    they don't want to hear. When evidence of a big problem appears,
    people will often ignore the information or reinterpret it in a less
    painful way.

-   Even in organizations where the first eight challenges are not
    significant, there is a risk that 'happy talk' from senior
    management or senior figures in the organization can create an
    unwarranted sense of security and success. Often this 'happy talk'
    is the result of a history of past successes. Past success can give
    individuals an ego and create an arrogant culture. Both factors can
    keep the sense of urgency low and hamper change.

> A good rule of thumb in any change initiative is never to
> underestimate the power of forces that might reinforce complacency and
> promote the status quo. The challenge of complacency must be
> addressed. An organization can't make any important decisions without
> tackling the real issues.

2.  *Pushing up the Urgency Level*

> To push up the urgency level requires removal of the sources of
> complacency or reduction of their impact. Creating a strong sense of
> urgency requires that leaders take bold or even risky actions. It is
> worth recalling how Deming admonished management to institute
> leadership as part of his 14 Points of Transformation.^104^
>
> 104 In *Out of the Crisis* (1982), W. Edwards Deming published his 14
> Points for Management Transformation.

![](./media/media/image235.png)

> Figure 115 Sources of Complacency
>
> *Bold* means doing something that might cause short term pain, not
> just something that looks good in a marketing email. In other words,
> it requires an *adoption of the new philosophy* (to borrow again from
> Deming). Moves bold enough to reduce complacency tend to cause
> short-term conflict and anxiety. However, if the conflict and anxiety
> can be channeled towards the change vision then a leader can
> capitalize on the short-term discomfort to build the long-term goals.
>
> Bold moves are difficult in the absence of supported and supportive
> leadership. Cautious senior managers who are unable to increase the
> sense of urgency will reduce the ability of an organization to change.

3.  *Using Crisis with Care*

> One way to push up urgency levels is to latch on to a visible crisis.
> It is sometimes said that major change is not possible until the very
> economic survival of the organization is at risk. However, it is not
> necessarily that the
>
> 5 8 6 • D MBOK 2
>
> change comes even then. An economic or financial crisis in an
> organization can often result in scarce but necessary resources being
> difficult to come by to support the change vision.
>
> It is possible to create a perceived crisis by bombarding the
> organization with information about problems, potential problems,
> potential opportunities, or by setting ambitious goals that disrupted
> the status quo. Kotter suggests that it is often easier to create a
> problem that (coincidentally) you have the plan to address.

4.  *The Role of Middle and Lower-level Managers*

> Depending on the scale of the target for the change (e.g., a
> department or business unit versus an entire organization), the key
> players will be the managers in charge of that unit. They will need to
> be able to reduce complacency in the teams under their direct control.
> If they have enough autonomy, they may be able to do this regardless
> of the pace of change in the rest of the organization.
>
> If there is not sufficient autonomy, then a change effort in a small
> unit can be doomed from the start as the external forces of inertia
> come to bear. Often senior executives need to reduce those forces.
> However, middle or lower-level managers can drive this kind of change
> if they act in a strategic way. For example, if they use analysis to
> clearly show the impact of not making the required change on a key
> strategic project. This is particularly effective when the debate can
> be diffused by directing it onto an external group such as an external
> consultancy who may have helped with the analysis.

5.  *How Much Urgency is Enough?*

> A sense of urgency about a problem leads people to conclude that the
> status quo is unacceptable. To sustain transformation for the long
> term, support from a critical mass of managers is required. Kotter
> suggests 75%. However, creating too much urgency can be
> counterproductive. Too much urgency may result in competing visions of
> change or cause a focus on 'firefighting'.
>
> A sufficiently compelling sense of urgency will help get the change
> process started and give it momentum. Sufficient urgency will also
> help in getting the right level of leadership in the Guiding
> Coalition. Ultimately, the sense of urgency needs to be strong enough
> to prevent complacency from reasserting itself after initial successes
> are achieved. One key approach is to tap into the 'voice of the
> customer' and speak to external customers, suppliers, shareholders, or
> other stakeholders about their perspective on the level of urgency

> change, two specific scenarios must be avoided:
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT A ND ORGA N IZAT ION AL CHA NG E MANA GEM ENT • 5 8
> 7

-   The Lone CEO / Lone Champion

-   The Low Credibility Committee

> The Lone CEO scenario puts the success or failure of the change effort
> in the hands of one person. The pace of change in most organization
> these days is such that one person cannot possibly manage it all. The
> pace of decision-making and communication slows, unless decisions are
> being taken without a full assessment of the issues. Either option is
> a recipe for failure.
>
> The Low Credibility Committee arises where a capable champion is given
> a 'task force' with representatives from a variety of functional
> departments (and perhaps some external consultants). What the task
> force lacks is sufficient representation (if any) from people at a
> senior level on the executive pecking order. If it is seen as
> "important but not *that* important" (again, because of the lack of
> commitment from top brass), people don't feel motivated to get a true
> understanding of the situation. Inevitably, the task force fails.
>
> It is essential to create a suitable Guiding Coalition that has the
> necessary management commitment to support the urgency of the need for
> change. In addition, the team has to support effective decision-making
> -- which requires high levels of trust within the team. A Guiding
> Coalition that works as a team can process more information faster. It
> also speeds the implementation of ideas because the decision-makers
> with power are truly informed and committed to key decisions.
>
> An effective Guiding Coalition has four key characteristics:

-   **Position Power**: Are enough key players on board, especially main
    line managers, so that those who are left out can't easily block
    progress?

-   **Expertise**: Are relevant points of view adequately represented so
    that informed and intelligent decisions will be made?

-   **Credibility**: Are enough people with good reputations in the
    organization on the team so that it will be taken seriously?

-   **Leadership**: Does the team have enough proven leaders on board to
    drive the change process?

> Leadership is a key concern. There must be a good balance between
> management and leadership skills on the Guiding Coalition. Management
> keeps the whole process under control. Leadership drives the change.
> One without the other will not achieve a sustainable result.
>
> Key issues that arise in the context of a building your Guiding
> Coalition include:
>
> *How many people do I need to help me define and guide this change?*
>
> The answer to this is a painfully consultant-like "It depends", but
> the size of the coalition relates to the size of the overall group
> being influenced. A balance needs to be struck between having a group
> that is too big and having a group that leaves key stakeholders
> feeling left 'outside the tent'.
>
> *Who should be involved or invited to join the Guiding Coalition?*
>
> The Guiding Coalition differs from a formal project or program
> steering committee in that it needs to provide a platform for
> influence throughout the organization. As such, the coalition needs to
> include representatives from
>
> 5 8 8 • D MBOK 2
>
> different stakeholder communities. However, it is not a general
> stakeholder requirements gathering forum either. Seek perspectives
> from people who may be impacted in the information value chain of the
> organization.
>
> One key attribute of the members of the Guiding Coalition is their
> ability to influence their peers, either through formal authority in
> the hierarchy or through their status and experience in the
> organization.
>
> Behavior is key in the Guiding Coalition.
>
> In the formulation of the Guiding Coalition, change leaders need to
> avoid behaviors that weaken the effectiveness, function, and reach of
> the team. For example, avoid:

-   **Naysaying**: Naysayers can hamper positive and open dialogue
    needed for the Guiding Coalition to develop creative ideas, to
    refine, implement, and evolve the change vision and identify
    opportunities for growth.

-   **Distraction**: Guiding Coalition team members need to be focused
    on the change activity. Unfocussed individuals can take the team off
    course, leading to delays or the failure to capitalize on early
    wins.

-   **Selfishness**: The Guiding Coalition's efforts move the
    organization as a whole and affect everyone. Hidden agendas must not
    be allowed to derail the team's efforts.

    1.  *The Importance of Effective Leadership in the Coalition*

> There is a difference between management and leadership. A Guiding
> Coalition with good managers but no leaders will not succeed. Missing
> leadership can be addressed by hiring from the outside, promoting
> leaders from within, and encouraging staff to step up to the challenge
> of leading.
>
> When putting your coalition together you need to be wary of what
> Kotter terms 'Egos', 'Snakes', and 'Reluctant Players'. 'Egos' are
> individuals who fill up the room and do not let others contribute.
> 'Snakes' are people who create and spread mistrust and distrust.
> 'Reluctant Players' are (usually) senior figures who see a moderate
> need for the change but don't fully grasp the urgency.
>
> Any of these personality types can hijack or undermine the change
> effort. Efforts should be made to keep them off the team or manage
> them closely to keep them on message.

2.  *Example in Information Management Context*

> In the context of an information management change initiative, the
> Guiding Coalition can help the organization identify opportunities to
> link initiatives in different areas that are engaged in different
> aspects of the same overall change.
>
> For example, in response to a regulatory requirement, a firm's
> in-house counsel may have begun to develop a map of data flows and
> processes in the organization. At the same time, a data warehousing
> initiative may have begun to map the lineage of data for verification
> of reporting accuracy and quality.
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT A ND ORGA N IZAT ION AL CHA NG E MANA GEM ENT • 5 8

>
> A data governance change leader might bring the head of legal and the
> head of reporting together on their Guiding Coalition to improve
> documentation and control of information processes in the context of
> data governance. This in turn might require input from the front-line
> teams using and creating data to understand the impacts of any
> proposed changes.
>
> Ultimately, a good understanding of the information value chain will
> help identify potential candidates to include in the Guiding
> Coalition.

3.  *Building an Effective Team*

> An effective team is based on two simple foundations: trust and a
> common goal. An absence of trust is often caused by a lack of
> communications and other factors such as misplaced rivalry. The
> classic 'Business vs. IT' divide is a good example of where trust
> breaks down. To build trust, engage in team building activities that
> create and promote mutual understanding, respect, and caring. In
> achieving that mutual understanding, though, care should be taken to
> avoid 'Group Think'.

4.  *Combating Group Think*

> 'Group Think' is a psychological effect that arises in highly coherent
> and cohesive groups, particularly ones that are isolated from sources
> of information that might contradict their opinions, or those that are
> dominated by a leader who encourages people to agree with his or her
> position rather than opening up discussion.
>
> In Group Think, everyone goes along with a proposal even where they
> have reservations about it. Group Think is probably operating if:

-   No one raises objections

-   No alternatives are offered

-   Different perspectives are quickly dismissed and die forever

-   Information that might challenge the thinking is not actively sought
    To prevent Group Think it is important to:

-   Encourage all participants to follow the scientific method of
    gathering data to help understand the nature and causes of a problem

-   Develop a list of criteria for evaluating all decisions

-   Learn to work together efficiently so that Group Think is not the
    short cut to getting things done faster

-   Encourage brainstorming

-   Leaders should speak last

-   Actively search for outside knowledge and input into meetings

-   Once a solution has been identified, have the team develop not just
    one plan but also a 'Plan B' (which forces them to rethink
    assumptions in the original plan)

5.  *Examples in Information Management Context*

> Group Think can arise in a variety of contexts. One potential area is
> the traditional 'Business vs IT divide', in which different parts of
> the organization are resistant to changes proposed by the other.
> Another potential scenario is where the organization's goal is to
> become data-driven with a focus on analytics and data gathering, which
> may result in privacy, security, or ethical issues in relation to
> information handling being discounted or deprioritized in the overall
> work plan.
>
> There are many reasons to apply data governance discipline in
> organizations. One key function is to ensure clarity about models and
> methods to be applied. This clarity will allow issues such as the
> Business / IT divide or balancing of competing priorities to be
> addressed appropriately and consistently.

6.  *Common Goals*

> If every member of the Guiding Coalition is pulling in a different
> direction, trust will break down.
>
> Typical goals that bind people are a commitment to excellence or a
> desire to see the organization perform at the highest level possible
> in a given area. These goals should not be confused with the vision
> for change but should be complementary to it.

####### Developing a Vision and Strategy

> A common mistake in change management efforts is to rely on either
> authoritarian decree or micromanagement to get the change moving.
> Neither approach is effective if the change situation is complex.
>
> If the goal is behavior change, unless the boss is very powerful,
> authoritarian decree approaches work poorly even in simple situations.
> Without 'the power of kings' behind it, an authoritarian decree is
> unlikely to break through all the forces of resistance. The Change
> Agents tend to be ignored, undermined, or worked around. Almost
> inevitably, some change resister will call the Change Agent's bluff to
> test the authority and clout behind the change process.
>
> Micromanagement tries to get around this weakness by defining in
> specific detail what employees should do and then monitoring
> compliance. This can overcome some of the barriers to change but will,
> over time, take increasing lengths of time as management have to spend
> more time detailing the work practices and methods for the new changed
> behaviors as the level of complexity associated with the change
> increases.
>
> The only approach that consistently allows Change Agents to break
> through the status quo is to base change on a clear and compelling
> vision that provides momentum.

> Figure 116 Vision Breaks Through Status Quo

1.  *Why Vision is Essential*

> A vision is a picture of the future with some implicit or explicit
> commentary about why people should strive to create that future. A
> good vision shares three important purposes: Clarification,
> motivation, and alignment.

-   **Clarification**: A good vision clarifies the direction of change
    and simplifies a range of more detailed decisions by setting key
    parameters. An effective vision (and supporting back up strategies)
    helps resolve issues that arise out of disagreements about direction
    or confusion about the motivation or drivers for the change. Endless
    debates can be avoided with a simple question: Is the planned action
    in line with the vision? Similarly, the vision can help clear the
    decks of clutter, allowing the team to focus efforts on priority
    projects that are contributing to the transformation effort.

-   **Motivation**: A clear vision motivates people to take steps in the
    right direction, even if the initial steps are personally painful.
    This is particularly true in organizations where people are being
    forced out of their comfort zones on a regular basis. When the
    future is depressing and demoralizing, the right vision can give the
    people an appealing cause to fight for.

-   **Alignment**: A compelling vision helps to align individuals and
    coordinate the actions of motivated people in an efficient way. The
    alternative is to have a flurry of detailed directives or endless
    meetings. Experience shows that without a shared sense of direction
    interdependent people can end up in cycles of constant conflict and
    nonstop meetings.

2.  *The Nature of an Effective Vision*

> A vision can be mundane and simple. It doesn't need to be grand or
> overarching. It is one element in the system of tools and processes
> for change; this system also includes strategies, plans, budgets, and
> more. Nevertheless, a vision is a very important factor because it
> demands that teams focus on tangible improvements.
>
> A effective vision has several key characteristics:

-   **Imaginable**: It conveys a picture of what the future looks like.

-   **Desirable**: It appeals to the *long-term* interests of employees,
    customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.

-   **Feasible**: It comprises realistic and attainable goals.

-   **Focused**: It is clear enough to provide guidance in
    decision-making.

-   **Flexible**: It is general enough to allow individuals to take the
    initiative and to allow for alternative plans and responses when
    conditions or constraints change.

-   **Communicable**: It is easy to share and to communicate in five
    minutes or less.

> The key test for the effectiveness of a vision is how easy it is to
> imagine it and for it to be desirable. A good vision can demand
> sacrifice but must keep the long-term interests of the people involved
> in scope. Visions that don't focus for the long term on the benefits
> to people are eventually challenged. Likewise, the vision must be
> rooted in the reality of the product or service market. In most
> markets, reality is that the end customer needs to be considered
> constantly.
>
> Key questions to ask are:

-   If this became real, how would it affect customers (internal and
    external)?

-   If this became real how would it affect shareholders? Will it make
    them happier? Will it deliver longer-term value for them?

-   If this became real, how would it affect employees? Would the work
    place be better, happier, less

> stressed, more fulfilling? Will we be able to become a better place to
> work in?
>
> Another key test is the strategic feasibility of the vision. A
> feasible vision is more than a wish. It may stretch resources and
> stretch capabilities but people recognize that is can be reached.
> Feasible does not mean easy, however. The vision must be challenging
> enough to force fundamental rethinking. Regardless of which stretch
> goals are set, the organization must ground that vision in a rational
> understanding of the market trends and the organization's capability.
>
> The vision must be focused enough to guide people but not so rigid
> that it handcuffs staff to increasingly irrational modes of behavior.
> Often the best approach is to aim for simplicity of vision while at
> the same time embedding enough specific hooks that the vision is still
> a valuable cornerstone and reference point for decision- making:
>
> *It is our goal to become the world leader in our industry within 5
> years. In this context, leadership means managing information more
> effectively to deliver greater revenues, more profit, and a more
> rewarding place for our people to work. Achieving this ambition will
> require a solid foundation of trust in our ability to make*
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT A ND ORGA N IZAT ION AL CHA NG E MANA GEM ENT • 5 9
> 3
>
> *decisions, clarity in our internal and external communications, an
> improved understanding of the information landscape in which we
> operate, and rational investments in appropriate tools and
> technologies to support a data-driven culture and ethos. This culture
> will be trusted and admired by shareholders, customers, employees, and
> communities.*

1.  *Creating the Effective Vision*

> Kotter advises that creating an effective vision is an iterative
> process that must have several clear elements to be successful.

-   **First draft**: A single individual makes an initial statement
    reflecting their dreams and the needs of the market place.

-   **Role of the Guiding Coalition**: The Guiding Coalition reworks the
    first draft to fit the wider strategic perspective.

-   **Importance of teamwork**: The group process never works well
    without teamwork. Encourage people to engage and contribute.

-   **Role of the head and heart**: Both analytical thinking and 'blue
    sky dreaming' are required throughout the activity.

-   **Messiness of the process**: This won\'t be a straightforward
    procedure; there will be much debate, rework, and change. If there
    isn't, something is wrong with the vision or the team.

-   **Time frame**: The activity is not a one meeting deal. It can take
    weeks, months, or even longer. Ideally, the vision should be
    constantly evolving.

-   **End product**: A direction for the future that is desirable,
    feasible, focused, flexible, and can be conveyed in five minutes or
    less.

####### Communicating the Change Vision

> A vision only has power when those involved in the change activity
> have a common understanding of its goals and direction, a common
> outlook on the desired future. Problems that commonly arise with
> communicating the vision include:

-   **Failure to communicate,** or to communicate enough.

-   **Poor communication**: Cumbersome or unwieldy wording that hides
    the sense of urgency; as a result, people don't listen carefully.

-   **Not communicating far enough**: Managers are trained to
    communicate up and down. Leaders need to communicate out and into
    broader constituencies. This range of communication requires leaders
    to have a clear sense of the problem and how it can be solved.

> Another challenge is dealing with the questions that are about the
> vision, from stakeholders, the Guiding Coalition, and the team
> implementing the change itself. Often the Guiding Coalition spends a
> lot of time working out these questions and preparing answers to them
> only to dump them on the organization in one quick hit (an FAQ page,
> notes to a briefing). The resulting information overload clouds the
> vision, creates short-term panic and resistance.
>
> Given that, in the average organization, the change message will
> account for not much more than one-half of one percent of the total
> communication going to an employee it is clear that simply dumping
> information will not be effective. The message needs to be
> communicated in a way that increases its effectiveness and amplifies
> the communication.
>
> Kotter identifies seven key elements in effective communication of
> vision:

-   **Keep it simple**: Strip out the jargon, internal vocabulary, and
    complex sentences.

-   **Use metaphor, analogy, and example**: A verbal picture (or even a
    graphical one) can be worth a thousand words.

-   **Use multiple forums**: The message needs to be communicable across
    a variety of different forums from elevator pitch to broadcast memo,
    from small meeting to an all-hands briefing.

-   **Repeat, repeat, repeat**: Ideas have to be heard many times before
    they are internalized and understood.

-   **Lead by example**: Behavior from important people needs to be
    consistent with the vision. Inconsistent behavior overwhelms all
    other forms of communication.

-   **Explain seeming inconsistencies**: Loose ends and unaddressed
    disconnects undermine the credibility of all communication.

-   **Give and take**: Two-way communication is always more powerful
    than one-way communication.

    1.  *Examples in Information Management Context*

> In an information management context, the failure to define or
> communicate a clear and compelling vision for a change can often be
> seen in initiatives where a new technology or capability is being
> rolled out driven by a
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT A ND ORGA N IZAT ION AL CHA NG E MANA GEM ENT • 5 9
> 5
>
> focus on technology deployment. In the absence of an understanding or
> appreciation of the potential information-handling benefits from the
> new technology or methods, there may be resistance on the part of
> stakeholders to adopt new ways of working.
>
> For example, if an organization is implementing Metadata-driven
> document and content management processes, business stakeholders may
> not engage with the up-front effort of understanding or applying
> Metadata tagging or classification of records if there is no clearly
> communicated vision of how this will be a benefit to the organization
> *and to them*. Absent that, the otherwise valuable initiative may get
> bogged down with lower than required levels of adoption and
> compliance.

2.  *Keeping it Simple*

> It is hard to emotionally connect with language that is unnatural,
> densely written, or difficult to understand.
>
> These examples illustrate the communication problems that can arise
> when the vision is not kept simple. The example below illustrates this
> point.
>
> *Our goal is to reduce our mean 'time to repair' parameter so that it
> is demonstrably lower than all major competitors in our target
> geographic and demographic markets. In a similar vein, we have
> targeted new- product development cycle times, order processing times,
> and other customer-related process vectors for change.*
>
> Translation: "*We're going to become faster than anyone in our
> industry at meeting customer needs.*"
>
> When the vision is articulated in a simple way, it is easier for
> teams, stakeholders, and customers to understand the proposed change,
> how it might affect them, and their role in it. This, in turn, helps
> them to more easily communicate it to their peers.

3.  *Use Many Different Forums*

> The communication of vision is usually more effective when different
> channels are used. There are various reasons for this, ranging from
> the fact that some channels can be overloaded with information or with
> 'baggage' of previous change initiatives, to the fact that different
> people interpret and process information differently. If people are
> being hit with the same message through different channels, it
> increases the likelihood that the message will be heard, internalized,
> and acted on. Related to this 'multi-channel / multi-format' approach
> is the need to keep repeating the vision and communicating progress.

4.  *Repetition, Repetition, Repetition*

> In many respects, change vision and change messages are like water in
> a river that encounters a boulder that must be overcome. The water
> does not burst through the dam immediately (unless it has a lot of
> force behind it,
>
> 5 9 6 • D MBOK 2

> in which case it tends to do so destructively) but over time, through
> iterative erosion the water wears down the boulder so it can flow
> around it.
>
> In the same way, change initiatives have to apply iterative retellings
> of the change vision in different forums and formats to engender a
> change that is 'sticky'. Which of these scenarios would be more
> effective?

-   Senior management put out a video message to all staff and a
    voicemail drop announcement to brief everyone on the change. Details
    on execution will follow from line managers. The intranet carries
    three articles over the next six months about the Vision, and there
    is a briefing session at the quarterly management conference
    (delivered at the end of the day). The plan includes six instances
    of communication with no fleshing out of details.

-   Senior management undertake to find four chances each day to have a
    change conversation and tie it back to the 'Big Picture'. They in
    turn task their direct reports with finding four chances, and with
    tasking their direct reports to find four chances. So, when Frank is
    meeting Product Development, he asks them to review their plans in
    the context of the Big Vision. When Mary is presenting a status
    update she ties it back to the contribution to the Vision. When
    Garry is presenting negative internal audit findings, he explains
    the impact in terms of the Vision. At each level of management, per
    manager there are countless opportunities for communication per year
    where the vision can be referenced. (This is also known as "Adopting
    the New Philosophy" and "Instituting Leadership", which are key
    points in W. Edwards Deming's 14 Points for Transformation in
    Quality Management.)

    1.  *Walking the Talk*

> There is no substitute for leadership by example. It makes the values
> and cultural aspects of the desired change tangible in a way that no
> amount of words can do. If for no other reason than that senior
> managers walking the talk engenders the development of stories about
> the vision and triggers discussion about the vision, this is an
> exceptionally powerful tool. The corollary is that telling people one
> thing and doing the opposite sends a clear message that the vision
> isn't that important and can be ignored when push comes to shove.
> Nothing undermines the change vision and efforts more than a senior
> member of the Guiding Coalition acting incongruently to the vision.

2.  *Example in Information Management Context*

> In information management context, failure to 'Walk the Talk' can be
> as simple as a senior manager sending files containing personal
> information about customers by an unsecured or unencrypted email
> channel in contravention of the information security policy, but
> receiving no sanction.
>
> It can also be as simple as the team leading an information governance
> initiative applying the principles and rigor they are asking the rest
> of the organization to adopt to their own activities, information
> handling, reporting, and responses to issues and errors.

> their own internal project records. If nothing else, it would help
> them to understand the practicalities of the change, but would also
> provide them with a good demonstration for others of the benefits of
> properly tagged and classified records and information.

3.  *Explaining Inconsistencies*

> Sometimes the inconsistency is unavoidable. It may be that, for
> tactical or operational reasons, or simply to get things moving within
> the overall organization system, a Change Agent might need to take an
> action that looks at variance with the stated vision. When this
> happens, it must be handled and addressed carefully to ensure the
> vision is sustained, even if a 'scenic route' is being taken. Examples
> of inconsistencies that can arise might include the use of external
> consultants when the organization is seeking to reduce costs or
> headcount. "Why is the organization bringing in these expensive suits
> when we're rationing printer paper?" people may ask. There are two
> ways to deal with apparent inconsistency. One of them is guaranteed to
> kill your vision. The other gives you a fighting chance of being able
> to keep things on track.
>
> The first option is to either ignore the question or react defensively
> and shoot the messenger. Invariably this winds up in an embarrassing
> climb down where the inconsistency is removed, and not always in a
> manner that is beneficial to the long-term objectives of the change.
> The second option is to engage with the question and explain the
> rationale for the inconsistency. The explanation must be simple,
> clear, and honest. For example, an organization bringing in
> consultants might respond like this:
>
> *We appreciate that it looks odd spending money on consultants when we
> are shaving costs everywhere else to achieve our vision of being lean,
> mean, and sustainably profitable. However, to make the savings
> sustainable we need to break out of old habits of thinking and learn
> new skills. That requires us investing in knowledge. And where we
> don't have that knowledge internally we must buy it in in the short
> term, and use that opportunity to build the knowledge up internally
> for the future. Every consultant is assigned to a specific project.
> And every project team has been tasked with learning as much as
> possible about their new function through shadowing the consultants
> and using them for formal training. In this way, we will make sure
> that we will have sustainable improvements into the future.*
>
> The key thing is to be explicit about the inconsistency and explicit
> about why the inconsistency is valid, and how long it will exist for
> if it is only a transient inconsistency.

4.  *Example in Information Management Context*

> Explaining inconsistencies is a very good example of the importance of
> data governance models that create agreed upon protocols for
> decision-making and promote the formal recognition and control of
> exceptions to rules.

5.  9 8 • D MBOK 2

> For example, if a governance standard requires that no testing should
> be done with live production data but a project requires this to
> verify data matching algorithms or to prove the effectiveness of data

> explanation of this variance from the expected standard. That is

> executes testing using live data *without* having appropriate
> approvals and risk assessments in place, then there should be a
> sanction ('walk the talk') or the basis for the non-application of the
> sanction should be equally clearly and explicitly explained.

1.  *Listen and Be Listened To*

> Stephen Covey advises people who want to be highly effective to "Seek
> first to understand, then to be understood." In other words, listen so
> that you will be listened to (Covey, 2013).
>
> Often the leadership team don't quite get the vision right, or they
> encounter a barrier or bottle neck that could have been avoided if
> they had been better informed. This lack of information leads to
> expensive errors and weakens the buy-in to and commitment to the
> Vision. Two-way conversations are an essential method of identifying
> and answering concerns people have about a change or about a vision
> for change. The Voice of the Customer is as important to the
> definition of and development of the vision as it is to any metric of
> quality in the data itself. And if every conversation is regarded as
> an opportunity to discuss the vision and to illicit feedback then,
> without having to formally tie people up in meetings, it is possible
> to have thousands of hours of discussion and to evolve the vision and
> how to execute it effectively.

2.  *Example in Information Management Context*

> In an information management context, two-way communication is best
> illustrated by a scenario where the IT function's view is that all
> data that is needed by key business stakeholders is available in a
> timely and appropriate manner, but business stakeholders are

##### The Formula for Change

> One of the most famous methods for describing the 'recipe' required
> for effective change, the Gleicher Formula, describes factors that
> need to be in place to overcome the resistance to change in the
> organization.

> According to the Gleicher Formula, Change (C) occurs when the level of
> dissatisfaction with the status quo (D) is combined with a vision of a
> better alternative (V) and some actionable first steps to get there
> (F) and the product of the three is enticing enough to overcome
> resistance (R) in the organization.

> Influencing any of the four variables in the Gleicher formula

> as with any complex machine, it is important to be aware of the risks
> inherent in pushing buttons and pulling levers:

-   Increasing dissatisfaction within the organization with the way
    things are working is a powerful tool and needs to be wielded with
    care lest it increases Resistance.

-   Developing a vision of the future will require a concrete and vivid
    vision of what people will do

> differently, what people will stop doing, or what they will start
> doing that they aren't doing now. Ensure that people can appreciate
> the new skills, attitudes, or work methods that will be required.
> Present these in a way that doesn't scare people away or create
> political barriers to the change by causing people to defend the
> status quo.

-   When describing the first steps to change, ensure they are
    achievable and explicitly tie them back to the vision.

-   Act to reduce resistance and avoid increasing resistance to change.
    To be blunt: Avoid alienating people. This requires a good
    understanding of the Stakeholders.

##### Diffusion of Innovations and Sustaining Change

> Ultimately, training and education must be put in place to deliver a
> sustainable information quality and data management change in an
> organization. Implementing change requires understanding how new ideas
> spread around the organization. This aspect of change is known as
> Diffusion of Innovations.
>
> Diffusion of Innovations is a theory that seeks to explain how, why,
> and at what rate new ideas and technology spread through cultures.
> Formulated in 1962 by Everett Rogers, it is related to the pop culture
> concept of the Idea Virus (<http://bit.ly/2tNwUHD)> as popularized by
> Seth Godin. Diffusion of Innovations has been applied consistently
> across a diverse range of fields from medical prescribing, to changes
> in farm husbandry methods, to the adoption of consumer electronics.
>
> The Diffusion of Innovations theory asserts that changes are initiated
> by a very small percentage (2.5%) of the total population, the
> Innovators, who tend (in the context of the society being examined) to
> be young, high in social class, and financially secure enough to
> absorb losses on bad choices. They have contact with technological
> innovators and a high risk tolerance. These are then followed by a
> further 13.5% of the population, Early Adopters, who share traits with
> Innovators, but are less tolerant of risk. Early Adopters understand
> how getting the choice right can help them maintain a central role in
> the society as people to be respected. Change is adopted next by the
> largest segments of the population, the Early and Late Majorities,

6.  0 0 • D MBOK 2

> which comprise 68% in total. Laggards are the last to adopt any
> specific innovation. (See Figure 118 and Table 37.)

+========+=============================================================+
| Inno   | Innovators are the first individuals to spot a better way   |
| vators | to tackle problems with the quality of information. They    |
|        | take risks trying to develop profiling of data, build       |
|        | tentative scorecards, and begin to put the symptoms         |
|        | experienced by the business into the language of            |
|        | Information Management. Often these innovators will use     |
|        | their own resources to get information and develop skills   |
|        | about best practices.                                       |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Early  | Early Adopters are the second fastest category of           |
| Ad     | individuals to adopt an innovation. These individuals have  |
| opters | the highest degree of opinion leadership among the other    |
|        | adopter categories. They are perceived as 'visionary'       |
|        | managers (or experienced managers, or managers responsible  |
|        | for emergent business strategy areas) who have realized     |
|        | information quality issues are a barrier to their success.  |
|        | Often they piggy back on the initial work of the Innovators |
|        | to develop their business case and begin to formalize       |
|        | information practices.                                      |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Early  | It takes the Early Majority significantly longer than the   |
| Ma     | Early Adopters to adopt an innovation. Early Majority tend  |
| jority | to be slower in the adoption process, have above average    |
|        | social status, contact with early adopters, and seldom hold |
|        | positions of opinion leadership in a system. They could be  |
|        | in the 'traditional core' areas of the organization where   |
|        | the impact of poor quality data is masked as the 'cost of   |
|        | business'.                                                  |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Late   | Individuals in the Late Majority approach an innovation     |
| Ma     | with a high degree of skepticism and after most society has |
| jority | adopted the innovation. Late Majority typically have below  |
|        | average social status, very little financial lucidity, in   |
|        | contact with others in late majority and early majority,    |
|        | very little opinion leadership. In Information Management   |
|        | terms, these can be areas of the organization where tight   |
|        | budgets might combine with skepticism about the proposed    |
|        | changes to generate resistance.                             |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| La     | Laggards are the last to adopt an innovation. Individuals   |
| ggards | in this category show little to no opinion leadership. They |
|        | are typically averse to change-agents and tend to be        |
|        | advanced in age. Laggards tend to focus on 'traditions'. In |
|        | Information Management, terms these are often the people or |
|        | areas of the business who resist because the 'new thing'    |
|        | means having to do the 'old thing' differently or not at    |
|        | all.                                                        |

####### The Challenges to be Overcome as Innovations Spread

> Two key challenge areas exist with the spread of innovations through
> the organization. The first is breaking past the Early Adopter stage.
> This requires careful management of change to ensure that the Early
> Adopters can identify a sufficient level of dissatisfaction with the
> status quo that they will make and persist with the change. This step
> is needed to reach the 'Tipping Point' where the innovation is adopted
> by enough people that it begins to become mainstream.
>
> The second key challenge point is as the innovation moves out of the
> Late Majority stage into the Laggards stage. The team needs to accept
> that they cannot necessarily convert 100% of the population to the new
> way of doing things. A certain percentage of the group may continue to
> resist change and the organization will need to decide what to do
> about this element of the group.

####### Key Elements in the Diffusion of Innovation

> Four key elements need to be considered when looking at how an
> innovation spreads through an organization:

-   **Innovation**: An idea, practice, or object that is perceived as
    new by an individual or other unit of adoption

-   **Communication channels**: The means by which messages get from one
    individual to another

-   **Time**: The speed at which the innovation is adopted by members of
    the social system

-   **Social system**: The set of interrelated units that are engaged in
    joint problem solving to accomplish a common goal

> In the context of information management, an innovation could be
> something as simple as the idea of the role of a Data Steward and the
> need for Stewards to work cross-functionally on common data problems
> rather than traditional 'silo' thinking.
>
> The process by which that innovation is communicated, and the channels
> through which it is communicated most effectively, are the
> communication channels which must be considered and managed.
>
> Finally, the idea of the Social System as a set of interrelated units
> that are engaged towards a joint venture. This is reminiscent of the
> System as described by W. Edwards Deming which must be optimized as a
> whole rather than piece-by-piece in isolation. An innovation that
> doesn't spread outside of a single business unit or team is not a well
> diffused change.

####### The Five Stages of Adoption

> The adoption of any change tends to follow a five-step cycle. It
> starts with individuals becoming aware of the innovation (Knowledge),
> being persuaded as to the value of the innovation and its relevance to
> them (Persuasion), and reaching the point of making a Decision about
> their relation to the innovation. If they do not
>
> 6 0 2 • D MBOK 2
>
> reject the innovation, they then move Implement and finally Confirm
> the adoption of the innovation. (See Table 38 and Figure 119.)
>
> Of course, because an idea can always be Rejected rather than adopted,
> the Tipping Point of critical mass of the Early Adopters and Early
> Majority is important.
>
> Table 38 The Stages of Adoption (Adapted from Rogers, 1964)

+==========+===========================================================+
| K        | In the knowledge stage the individual is first exposed to |
| nowledge | an innovation but lacks information about the innovation. |
|          | During this stage the individual has not yet been         |
|          | inspired to find more information about the innovation.   |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Pe       | In the persuasion stage the individual is interested in   |

+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Decision | In the Decision stage the individual weighs the           |
|          | advantages and disadvantages of using the innovation and  |
|          | decides whether to adopt or reject it. Rogers notes that  |
|          | the individualistic nature of this stage makes it the     |
|          | most difficult stage about which to acquire empirical     |
|          | evidence.                                                 |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Implem   | In the Implementation stage the individual employs the    |
| entation | innovation and determines its usefulness or searches for  |
|          | further information about it.                             |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Conf     | In the Confirmation stage, the individual finalizes       |
| irmation | his/her decision to continue using the innovation and may |
|          | end up using it to its fullest potential.                 |

####### Factors Affecting Acceptance or Rejection of an Innovation or Change

> People make largely rational choices when accepting or rejecting an
> innovation or change. Key to these is whether the innovation offers
> any relative advantage over the previous way of doing things.
>
> Consider the modern smartphone. It presented a clear advantage over
> previous smartphones because it was easy to use, stylish to look at,
> and has an App store where the product's capabilities could be
> extended quickly and
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT A ND ORGA N IZAT ION AL CHA NG E MANA GEM ENT • 6 0
> 3
>
> easily. Likewise, implementation of data management tools,
> technologies, and techniques have relative advantages over manual
> rekeying of data, bespoke coding, or resource intensive manual data
> search and discovery activities.
>
> For example, in many organizations there can be resistance to simple
> document and content management changes such as tagging files with
> Metadata to provide context. However, the use of that Metadata in turn
> provides a relative advantage in terms of supporting security
> controls, retention schedules, and simple tasks such as information
> search and retrieval. Linking the hassle of tagging to the time saved
> either searching for information or dealing with issues where
> information is shared or disclosed without authorization can help
> demonstrate this relative advantage.
>
> Once individuals see that an improvement is proposed, they will ask
> whether the improvement is compatible with their life, their way of
> working, etc. Returning to the smartphone example, the fact that it
> blended a high quality mp3 player, email, phone, etc., meant that it
> was compatible with the lifestyle and ways of working of its target
> users.
>
> To understand compatibility, a consumer will (consciously or
> sub-consciously) consider several factors. For example, the complexity
> or simplicity of the change. If the innovation is too difficult to
> use, then it is less likely to be adopted. Again, the evolution of
> smartphone and tablet platforms is littered with failed attempts that
> didn't achieve the goal of a simple user interface. The ones that did
> so redefined the expectation of the market and inspired similar
> interfaces on other devices.
>
> *Trialability* refers to how easy it is for the consumer to experiment
> with the new tool or technology. Hence freemium offers for tools. The
> easier it is to 'kick the tires' the more likely the user will adopt
> the new tool or innovation. The importance of this is that it helps
> establish the understanding of relative advantage, the compatibility
> with the life style and culture of the organization, and the
> simplicity of the change. As a set of first steps towards a change
> vision, iterative prototyping and 'trying it out' with stakeholders is
> essential and can help cement the Guiding Coalition as well as
> ensuring early adopters are on-board.
>
> *Observability* is the extent that the innovation is visible. Making
> the innovation visible will drive communication about it through
> formal and personal networks. This can trigger negative reactions as
> well as positive reactions. Plan on how to handle negative feedback.
> The experience of seeing people using a new technology or working with
> information in a particular way (e.g., visualization of traditionally
> 'dry' numbers) can influence how to better communicate back the
> experience.

##### Sustaining Change

> Getting change started requires a clear and compelling vision and
> clear and immediate first steps, a sense of urgency or dissatisfaction
> with the status quo, a Guiding Coalition, and a plan to avoid the
> pitfalls and traps that Change Agents can fall into as they begin
> their change journey.
>
> 6 0 4 • D MBOK 2
>
> However, a common problem in information management initiatives (e.g.,
> Data Governance programs) is that they are initiated in response to a
> specific driver or to a particular symptom of sub-optimal capability
> in the organization. As the symptom is addressed, the sense of
> dissatisfaction and urgency lessens. It becomes harder to sustain
> political or financial support, particularly when competing with other
> projects.
>
> It is outside the scope of this work to provide detailed analysis or
> tools for how these complex issues might be addressed. However, in the
> context of a Body Of Knowledge it is appropriate to refer back to the
> change management principles outlined in this chapter to provide some
> insight as to how solutions might be found.

####### Sense of Urgency / Dissatisfaction

> It is important to maintain the sense of urgency. The corollary of
> this is to be alert to emerging areas of dissatisfaction in the
> organization and how the information management change might help
> support improvement.
>
> For example, the scope of a data governance initiative that has been
> implemented to support a data privacy regulatory requirement can be
> broadened to address information quality issues in relation to
> personal data. That can be related back to the primary scope of the
> initiative, as most data privacy regulations have a data quality
> component and provide a right of access to data to individuals, so
> there is a risk of poor quality data being exposed. However, it opens
> the vision of the data governance program up to include information
> quality methods and practices which can be implemented as a 'second
> wave' once the core data privacy governance controls are in place.

####### Framing the Vision

> A common mistake is to confuse project scope with change vision. Many
> projects may be required achieve the vision. It is important the
> vision be set in a way that allows broad based action and does not
> create a cul-de-sac for the change leaders once the initial 'low
> hanging fruit' projects are delivered.
>
> There is a difference between a vision that says:
>
> *We will implement a structured governance framework for personal data
> to ensure compliance with EU Data Privacy rules.*
>
> and one that says:
>
> *We will lead our industry in repeatable and scalable approaches and
> methods for managing our critical information assets to ensure
> profits, reduce risks, improve quality of service, and balance our
> ethical obligations as stewards of personal information.*
>
> The first is, more or less, an objective. The second provides
> direction for the organization.
>
> DATA MAN AGE MENT A ND ORGA N IZAT ION AL CHA NG E MANA GEM ENT • 6 0

####### The Guiding Coalition

> Restricting the membership of the Guiding Coalition to the most
> immediately affected stakeholders will restrict change effectiveness.
> As with vision, it is important not to confuse project steering groups
> who are overseeing the delivery of specific deliverables with the
> coalition who are guiding and evolving the vision for change in the
> organization.

####### Relative Advantage and Observability

> While the specific application or focus of a change initiative might
> be narrow, in most cases the principles, practices, and tools that are
> applied may be transferrable to other initiatives. Being able to
> demonstrate how the approach and methods can give a relative advantage
> to other initiatives in the organization can help extend the Guiding
> Coalition and identify new areas of urgency or dissatisfaction that
> the change initiative can support.
>
> For example, in a utility company, data quality profiling and
> score-carding methods and tools that are implemented for a single view
> of customer implementation may be directly transferrable to a
> regulatory billing compliance program. Linking the two would lend
> itself to an Enterprise Data Quality Scorecard and associated data
> governance and remediation initiatives, particularly where sub-optimal
> approaches such as manual data clean-up might be the default option
> for billing data.

##### Communicating Data Management Value

> Helping an organization understand the importance of data management
> often requires a formal organizational change management plan, as
> described in this chapter. Such a plan helps the organization
> recognize the value of its data and the contribution of data
> management practices to that value. Once a Data Management program is
> established, however, it is also necessary to cultivate ongoing
> support. Ongoing communication promotes understanding and sustains
> support. If communications are structured as a two-way channel, a
> communications plan can help strengthen partnerships by enabling
> stakeholders to share concerns and ideas. This kind of communications
> effort requires planning.

####### Communications Principles

> The purpose of any communication is to send a message to a receiver.
> When planning communications, one needs to account for the message,
> the media used to convey it, and the audiences for which it is
> intended. To support this basic structure, certain general principles
> apply to any formal communications plan, regardless of topic. These
> are very important when communicating about data management because
> many people do not understand the importance of data management to
> organizational success. An overall communications plan and each
> individual communication should:
>
> 6 0 6 • D MBOK 2

-   Have a clear objective and a desired outcome

-   Consist of key messages to support the desired outcome

-   Be tailored to the audience / stakeholders

-   Be delivered via media that are appropriate to the audience /
    stakeholders

> While communications may be on a range of topics, the general goals of
> communicating boil down to:

-   Informing

-   Educating

-   Setting goals or a vision

-   Defining a solution to a problem

-   Promoting change

-   Influencing or motivating action

-   Gaining feedback

-   Generating support

> Most importantly, in order to communicate clearly, it is necessary to
> have substantive messages to share with people. Overall communications
> about data management will be more successful if the data management
> team understands the current state of data management practices and
> has a vision and mission statement that connects improvement in data
> management practices directly to the strategic goals of the
> organization. Data management communications should strive to:

-   Convey the tangible and intangible value of data management
    initiatives

-   Describe how data management capabilities contribute to business
    strategy and results

-   Share concrete examples of how data management reduces costs,
    supports revenue growth, reduces risk, or improves decision quality

-   Educate people on fundamental data management concepts to increase
    the base of knowledge about data management within the organization

####### Audience Evaluation and Preparation

> Communications planning should include a stakeholder analysis to help
> identify audiences for the communications that will be developed.
> Based on results of the analysis, content can be then tailored to be
> relevant, meaningful, and at the appropriate level, based on the
> stakeholder needs. For example, if the goal of the communications plan
> is to gain sponsorship for an initiative, target the communications to
> the highest possible influencers, usually executives who want to know
> the bottom line benefit of any program they fund.
>
> Tactics for persuading people to act on communications include various
> ways of getting people to see how their interests align with the goals
> of the program.
>

-   **Solve problems**: Messages should describe how the data management
    effort will help solve problems pertinent to the needs of the
    stakeholders being addressed. For example, individual contributors
    have needs different from executives. IT has needs that are
    different from those of business people.

-   **Address pain points**: Different stakeholders will have different
    pain points. Accounting for these pain points in communications
    materials will help the audience understand the value of what is
    being proposed. For example, a compliance stakeholder will be
    interested in how a Data Management program will reduce risk. A
    marketing stakeholder will be interested in how the program helps
    them generate new opportunities.

-   **Present changes as improvements**: In most cases, introducing data
    management practices requires that people change how they work.
    Communications need to motivate people to desire the proposed
    changes. In other words, they need to recognize changes as
    improvements from which they will benefit.

-   **Have a vision of success**: Describing what it will be like to
    live in the future state enables stakeholders to understand how the
    program impacts them. Sharing what success looks and feels like can
    help the audience understand the benefits of the Data Management
    program.

-   **Avoid jargon**: Data management jargon and an emphasis on
    technical aspects will turn some people off and detract from the
    message.

-   **Share stories and examples**: Analogies and stories are effective
    ways to describe and help people remember the purposes of the Data
    Management program.

-   **Recognize fear as motivation**: Some people are motivated by fear.
    Sharing the consequences of not managing data (e.g., fines,
    penalties) is a way to imply the value of managing data well.
    Examples of how the lack of data management practices has negatively
    affected a business unit will resonate.

> Effective delivery of communications involves monitoring the
> listeners' reactions to the message. If a given tactic is not working,
> adapt and try a different angle.

####### The Human Element

> The facts, examples, and stories shared about a Data Management
> program, are not the only things that will influence stakeholder
> perceptions about its value. People are influenced by their
> colleagues, and leaders. For this reason, communication should use the
> stakeholder analysis to find where groups have like interests and
> needs. As support broadens for the data management effort, supporters
> can help share the message with their peers and leadership.
>

|            | for different audiences.                                |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Style      | Both the level of formality and the level of detail in  |
|            | messages should be tailored to the audience. Executives |
|            | need less detail than teams responsible for             |
|            | implementation of                                       |
|            |                                                         |
|            | projects. Style is also influenced by organizational    |
|            | culture.                                                |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Channel,   | The means and format through which the message will be  |
| Method,    | conveyed (e.g., web page, blog,                         |
| Medium     |                                                         |
|            | email, one-on-one meetings, small group or large group  |
|            | presentations, lunch and learn sessions, workshops,     |
|            | etc.) Different media have different effects.           |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Timing     | How a message is received may be influenced by when it  |
|            | is received. Employees are more likely to read an email |
|            | that comes out first thing Monday morning than one that |
|            | comes out last thing on Friday afternoon. If the        |
|            | purpose of a communication is to gain support in        |
|            | advance to a budget cycle, then it should be timed in   |
|            | relation to the budget cycle.                           |
|            |                                                         |
|            | Information about impending changes to processes should |
|            | be shared in a timely manner and in advance of a change |
|            | taking place.                                           |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Frequency  | Most messages need to be repeated in order to ensure    |
|            | all stakeholders hear them. The communications plan     |
|            | should schedule the sharing of messages so that         |
|            | repetition is helpful in getting the message across and |
|            | does not become an annoyance. In addition, ongoing      |
|            | communications (for example, a newsletter) should be    |
|            | published based on an agreed-to                         |
|            |                                                         |
|            | schedule.                                               |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Materials  | The communications plan should identify any materials   |
|            | that need to be created to execute the plan. For        |
|            | example, short and long versions of presentation and    |
|            | other written communications, elevator speeches,        |
|            | executive summaries, and marketing materials like       |
|            |                                                         |
|            | posters, mugs, and other means of visual branding.      |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Com        | The communications plan should identify the person or   |
| municators | people who will deliver communications. Often the       |
|            | person delivering the message has a profound influence  |
|            | on the target audience. If the data management sponsor  |
|            | or other executive delivers a message, stakeholders     |
|            | will have a different response than if a lower level    |
|            | manager delivers it.                                    |
|            |                                                         |
|            | Decisions about who will communicate which messages to  |
|            | which stakeholders should be                            |
|            |                                                         |
|            | based on the goals of the message.                      |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Expected   | The communications plan should anticipate how different |
| Response   | stakeholder groups, and sometimes how individual        |
|            | stakeholders, will respond to communications. This work |
|            | can be accomplished by anticipating questions or        |
|            | objections and formulating responses. Thinking          |
|            |                                                         |
|            | through potential responses is a good way to clarify    |
|            | goals and build robust messages to support them.        |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Metrics    | The communications plan should include measures of its  |
|            | own effectiveness. The goal is to ensure that people    |
|            | have understood and are willing and able to act on the  |
|            | messages in the plan. This can be accomplished through  |
|            | surveys, interviews, focus groups, and other feedback   |
|            | mechanisms. Changes in behavior are the ultimate test   |
|            | of a communications                                     |
|            |                                                         |
|            | plan's success.                                         |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Budget and | The communications plan must account for what resources |
|            | are needed to carry out goals                           |
| Resource   |                                                         |
| Plan       | within a given budget.                                  |

####### Keep Communicating

> A Data Management program is an ongoing effort, not a one-time
> project. Communications efforts that support the program need to be
> measured and sustained for ongoing success.
>
> New employees are hired and existing employees change roles. As
> changes happen, communication plans need to be refreshed. Stakeholder
> needs change over time as Data Management programs mature. Time is
> needed for people to absorb messages, and hearing messages multiple
> times helps stakeholders to retain this knowledge. The methods of
> communication and messages will also need to be adapted over time as
> understanding grows.
>
> The competition for funding never goes away. One goal of a
> communications plan is to remind stakeholders of the value and
> benefits of the Data Management program. Showing progress and
> celebrating successes is vital to gaining continued support for the
> effort.
>
> Effective planning and ongoing communication will demonstrate the
> impact that data management practices have had on the organization
> over time. Over time, knowledge of data's importance changes the
> organization's way of thinking about data. Successful communication
> provides a better understanding that data management can generate
> business value from information assets and have a long lasting impact
> on the organization.
